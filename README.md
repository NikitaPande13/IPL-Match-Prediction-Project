# IPL-Match-Prediction-Project

Supervised Learning
Project:IPL_match_win_probability
## Install
This project requires Python and the following Python libraries installed:

* [Numpy:https://www.numpy.org]
* [Pandas:https://pandas.pydata.org/]
* [scikit-learn:https://scikit-learn.org/]

# You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook
If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 2.7 installer and not the Python 3.x installer.

Code

* Template code is provided in the CarPricePrediction.ipynb notebook file. You will also be required to use the Car Price Prediction.xlsx dataset file to complete your work. While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality when requested to successfully complete the project.

Run
